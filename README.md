# Numerical Optimization Final Project

This repository contains our final project for the **Numerical Optimization** course at Reichman University (Spring 2025), taught by **Professor Yonathan Mizrahi**. The project explores theoretical foundations and practical implementations of:

- **Cones and Convex Cones**
- **Proper Cones and Generalized Inequalities**
- **Conic Form Optimization Problems (LP, SDP, SOCP)**
- **Total Variation Image Denoising using SOCP**
- **Extension of the Interior Point Method via the Barrier Method**

We provide both Python implementations (e.g., using `cvxpy`) and explanatory graphs for use in our presentation.
